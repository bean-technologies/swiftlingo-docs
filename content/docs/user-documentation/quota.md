Your monthly quota represents the amount of words you can translate on a monthly basis. Choosing the right plan for your project is important to ensure all your pages can be translated.


## How word count works

Wordcount is calculated with two factors:

1. The number of words in your original site content
2. The number of languages you're translating into

For example, if your website has 6,000 words, and you're translating your content into three languages, you need a monthly quota of at least `6,000 words * 3 translation languages = 24,000 words`.

## Monthly quota

Your monthly quota is allocated as part of your billing cycle. This means you get your full quota from your plan at the start of each cycle.


## What counts as word count

A word can be both visible and invisible content, such as SEO meta tags or page titles. All words on your website are considered.
